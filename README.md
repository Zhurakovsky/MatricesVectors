# MatricesVectors
Write two classes in C++ : One class shall be a matrix class and one shall be a vector class. 

    Matrices and vectors shall be able to be multiplied. 
    Addition and scalar multiplication shall be supported as well. 
    No linear algebra functions are sought for (e.g. inverse, linear solving, svd etc.). 

The focus is on correctness, efficiency and a clean and convincing software design.
